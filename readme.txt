A non-official translation for the X theme into German

== Description ==

Themeco produced this awesome theme called X (see [theme.co/x](https://theme.co/x/)). Unfortunately, there are no translations available and since I'm using it on a few sites in German, I decided to publish my *non-official* translation here. Feel free to use it.
If you find any mistakes, let me know ([linusmetzler.me](http://linusmetzler.me))!

== Installation ==

1. Upload `x-theme-translation-german` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. If your language setting is set to `de_DE` it'll work automatically
