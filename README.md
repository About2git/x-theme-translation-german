A non-official translation for the X theme into German

## Description

Themeco produced this awesome theme called X (see [theme.co/x](https://theme.co/x/)). Unfortunately, there are no translations available and since I'm using it on a few sites in German, I decided to publish my *non-official* translation here. Feel free to use it.
If you find any mistakes, let me know ([linusmetzler.me](http://linusmetzler.me))!

*Please note:* At the moment, only strings I actually need are translated. I'd be happy to see a pull request!

## Installation

1. Upload `x-theme-translation-german` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. If your language setting is set to `de_DE` it'll work automatically

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is everything still English?

You probably have some other language code (`WP_LANG`) in your `wp-config.php` than `de_DE` (e.g `de_CH`). [See the codex on how to change your language.](https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress_in_Your_Language)

### Why are some texts still English?

Because I haven't translated everything yet. Any help is welcome!
